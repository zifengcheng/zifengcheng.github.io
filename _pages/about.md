I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Software Institute, Nanjing University.
I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer Science at Nanjing University in June 2025 under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://isetnju.github.io/guq/index.html" target="_black">Qing Gu (顾庆)</a> and Assistant Professor <a href="https://zhiweinju.github.io/" target="_black"> Zhiwei Jiang (蒋智威)</a>.

From May 2022 to March 2023, I was a research intern at Tencent Cloud Xiaowei, where I worked under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.qyzhou.com/" target="_black">Qingyu Zhou (周青宇)</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Z_IPFVYAAAAJ" target="_black">Zhao Yan (闫昭)</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nNVDLb4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao" target="_black">Yunbo Cao (曹云波)</a>.
  
Main Research Interests
======

I have a broad interest in large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP). Currently, I am primarily focusing on the following aspects:

* Intervention and Editing Techniques for LLMs
  
* Test-time or training-free algorithm for LLMs

* Attack and Defense of LLMs, mainly including model extraction attacks and watermarking

<!-- Hallucinations of LLMs-->

<!-- Downstream task adaptation of LLMs, including parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and few-shot or zero-shot learning on NLP tasks-->

<!--My prior research experience included both emotion-cause pair extraction, open intent classification, multi-label text classification, essay scoring, and so on.-->
